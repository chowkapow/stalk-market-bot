# stalk-market-bot

Discord chat bot for insider trading in Animal Crossing: New Horizons' Stalk Market

In AC, there’s a pseudo “stalk” market where turnips are the stock. You can buy turnips only on Sunday, and sell them only on Mon-Sat.
The sell price 1) changes daily and 2) is different between morning and afternoon = 2 prices per day.

The purpose of this bot is share what your price is because every one gets different prices. You can go to other people’s islands and sell your turnips there, or they can come to yours.

Add your turnip prices via the bot commands to share with your friends. Find the lowest buying price and the highest selling prices to profit easily!
